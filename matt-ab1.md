```Scenario: Energy Grid Component company that let's you add modules to interact with data for your private energy footprint. Think components that you plug into your solar panels, wind turbines, and meter. They're currently working on a consumer mobile app to interact with this data, and have a monolithic application that's run out of a data center. They also handle the manufacturing and design of these devices, and would love to see how they could improve their process```

**Notes**

- good obj handling for double dipping
  - didn't get back on this
- He used the rabbit whole on pillars as an opportunity to get a next meeting, well played!
- for business related questions, remember you can mention we have an Account Executive
- timing was good in general, a bit tight at the end.
- getting in serverless rabbit whole. A short description of serverless should be enough.
- when reviewing follow ups, capture most of the requests but  missed 2 important ones:
  - security question by Conor
  - migration costs by Diego
